# Banking System with Advanced Security

This project is a C++-based banking system with advanced security features. It allows users to create accounts, deposit and withdraw funds, and check their account information. The system also incorporates advanced security measures to protect user data and mitigate common security threats.

## Features

1. **Banking System**:
   - Users can create accounts.
   - Deposit and withdraw funds.
   - Check their account information.
   - Accounts and transactions are securely managed.

2. **Advanced Security**:
   - **Password Hashing**: Passwords are securely hashed and salted before storage.
   - **Secure Input Handling**: Input sanitization to prevent common vulnerabilities.
   - **Authentication**: A secure authentication system ensures authorized access.
   - **Session Management**: Secure session handling for user interactions.

3. **DDoS Protection**:
   - Network-level security measures to mitigate DDoS attacks.
   - Firewalls, rate limiting, and intrusion detection systems (IDS).

4. **Virtual Private Network (VPN)**:
   - Enhanced security using third-party VPN services or software.

5. **Web Interface**:
   - HTML, CSS, and JavaScript-based web interface for user interaction.
   - Secure communication between the web frontend and the C++ backend.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following components:
- `banking_system.cpp`: The core C++ banking system application.
- `web_interface/`: Web frontend files.

## Getting Started

To run the banking system, follow these steps:
1. Compile and run the `banking_system.cpp` file.
2. Access the web interface by opening `web_interface/index.html` in a web browser.

## Security and Compliance

Ensure that your implementation complies with all legal and security standards for financial services. Seek advice from security experts and follow industry best practices for data protection and customer privacy.
